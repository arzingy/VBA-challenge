## Storing prices?
As I mentioned in the comment of .vbs file, I find storage of open and close prices for each row unnecessary.
In order to make the program work faster <i>(with the current data the difference was approximately 10 sec!)</i>, some lines <b>(under the comments ending with *; they are left in the original code
in order to meet the requirements of the homework)</b> can be changed 
for another lines <b>(left in comments ending in **)</b>. In the screenshot
below the lines that i find more rational to use are underlined in $${\color{green}green}$$, and the lines that are needed to be deleted are underlined in $${\color{red}red}$$.
